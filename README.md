# Data Compression Algorithms Testing

This repository contains Python code to test the performance of two data compression algorithms: Huffman Tree and Lempel-Ziv.

## Overview

Data compression is a fundamental concept in computer science and information theory. It involves encoding data to reduce its size, making it more efficient for storage and transmission. Two popular compression algorithms are implemented and tested in this repository.

## Algorithms

### Huffman Tree

Huffman coding is a widely used compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. The more frequent a character, the shorter its code.

### Lempel-Ziv

Lempel-Ziv is a family of data compression algorithms that use dictionary-based methods to represent repetitive patterns in the data. It's known for its simplicity and effectiveness in certain scenarios.

## Testing

The Python code in this repository tests the performance of both algorithms on three datasets of different lengths: 1000, 10000, and 100000 characters. The goal is to evaluate how these algorithms handle data of various sizes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SulimanFastian/Huffman_tree.git
